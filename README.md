# HekaHeka Mini-App Documentation

## 1. Overview
HekaHeka is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Base blockchain, designed to transform user-submitted memories, stories, and images into AI-generated comic books minted as ERC-721 NFTs. By integrating Base AgentKit for onchain AI story generation, HekaHeka enables creators to craft personalized comics, mint them as NFTs, and trade them in a decentralized marketplace. The platform is tailored for creators, collectors, and communities, with a focus on accessibility for African users through low-cost transactions and fiat payment options.

This project is developed for the [Base Batch Africa hackathon](https://base-batch-africa.devfolio.co/overview), showcasing Base's scalability and AgentKit's AI capabilities to empower creators globally.

        comicNFT = ComicNFT(_comicNFT);
    }

    function listComic(uint256 tokenId, uint256 price) external payable {
        require(msg.value >= listingFee, "Insufficient listing fee");
        require(comicNFT.ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, "Not the owner");
        require(price > 0, "Price must be greater than 0");

        comicNFT.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId);
        listings[tokenId] = Listing(tokenId, msg.sender, price, true);
        emit ComicListed(tokenId, msg.sender, price);
    }

    function buyComic(uint256 tokenId) external payable {
        Listing memory listing = listings[tokenId];
        require(listing.active, "Comic not listed");
        require(msg.value >= listing.price, "Insufficient payment");

        uint256 royaltyAmount = (listing.price * comicNFT.royalties(tokenId)) / 10000;
        uint256 sellerAmount = listing.price - royaltyAmount;

        listings[tokenId].active = false;
        comicNFT.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);
        payable(comicNFT.creators(tokenId)).transfer(royaltyAmount);
        payable(listing.seller).transfer(sellerAmount);

## 12. Figma Design Integration
The Figma designs (from `Comichain-pages-1.pdf` to `Comichain-pages-6.pdf`) are reflected in the UI:
- **Navigation**: Consistent "HOME," "HOW IT WORKS," "MINT," "MARKETPLACE" links across pages.
- **Landing Page**: Minimalist with repetitive "MINT" and "MARKETPLACE" text, emphasizing core actions.
- **Image Upload**: "CRAFT FOUR CHARACTERS" guides users to associate images with names.
- **Purchase Page**: Clear pricing (15 ETH full comic, 2 ETH per page) and blockchain transparency.
- **Comic Preview**: Multi-page layout inferred from `Comichain-pages-4.pdf` (long numbered list suggests paginated content).
- **Marketplace**: Grid layout with repeated "MARKETPLACE" text for emphasis.

**Note**: `Comichain-pages-4.pdf` (numbers 1–899) is interpreted as a placeholder for paginated comic content or a long-scroll preview. The actual comic will be 3–10 pages, as specified.
